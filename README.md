# ibooks_highlights_export

Original [script](https://github.com/shrsv/ibooks_highlights_export) by shrsv was updated with GUI inteface and export for Open Mind Map format. 

Now you can just run python script and select a book you want to export. 

## Usage

Simplest way to get your highlights:

```
$ poetry install
$ poetry run python3 ibooks_highlights_exporter.py
```

## Packaging an app

You can help with building a bundle for Mac OS with py2app. There were some problems with following official tutorials, related to importing jinja2 module.

Building a package is as simple as:

```
$ python setup.py py2app
```

But then application refuses to run from system (though it succesfully runs from terminal).
